## Dataset

We use the **Sentiment Polarity Dataset v1.0** from Cornell:
- Link: [Cornell Movie Review Data](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/)
- It contains:
  - `pos/` folder: positive movie reviews
  - `neg/` folder: negative movie reviews

The dataset is split into:
- **Training Set** (for training the ML model)
- **Test Set** (for evaluating performance)

---

## Process Workflow

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- Reading all `.txt` files
- Removing Duplicates and Stopwords
- Removing punctuation, special characters
- Tokenization and stop word removal
- Lowercasing and normalization

### 2. **Feature Extraction**
- Used **TF-IDF Vectorization** to convert text data into numerical features.

### 3. **Model Training and Testing**
- ML Models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Naive Bayes
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest
  - KNN
  - Decision Tree
- ML Models:
  - LSTM
  - RNN
  - GRU
- Dataset split: 80% training / 20% testing
- Performance metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report

### 4. **Visualizing Results**
- Accuracy comparison bar chart
- Confusion matrix heatmap
- Model training performance curve (if applicable)

### 5. **Saving the Best Model**
- The best-performing model is saved using `joblib` or `pickle`.

## Results
### Best Model --> ML Model (SVM Model: with Kernel => Linear)
### * Best Parameters: {'C': 1}
### * Best CV F1-Score: 89.49%
### * Train Accuracy: 95.875%
### * Test Accuracy: 87.75%

## Notes

- Ensure the dataset folders are correctly named `pos` and `neg`.
- This notebook is intended for educational use and could be expanded with deep learning models or hyperparameter tuning.
